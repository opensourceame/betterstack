# PHP Test Project

### Description
This is a very simple one-page application consisting of a single table and a form for creating new rows. To make it a little more complicated, we have written a 'framework' you have to use. Below is a set of simple tasks to perform. Please write a production-ready code.

### Installation
1. Create a private GitHub repository and invite @jurajmasar and @gyfis and @KubqoA as collaborators
2. Create a new MySQL database
3. Rename `config/database` to `config/database.php` and configure your database connection settings in this file
4. Import `database/schema.sql` into your database

### Tasks to perform
1. Style the page using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or [Tailwind](http://tailwind.com/)
  * Every other table row should be highlighted.
  * Use Bootstrap‚Äôs form-horizontal or equivalent to style the form.
  * Please make any other styling changes based on your preferences to make the interface look presentable.
2. Add a validation of new records.
3. Create a JS functionality to filter rows by city.
4. Implement submission of the form using AJAX.
5. Add a phone number column to the table.
6. Please deploy the project to any freehosting and send us the production link.

Thank you! üôè
